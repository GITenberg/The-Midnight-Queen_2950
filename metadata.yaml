description: The plague raged in the city of London. The destroying angel had gone
  forth, and kindled with its fiery breath the awful pestilence, until all London
  became one mighty lazar-house. Thousands were swept away daily; grass grew in the
  streets, and the living were scarce able to bury the dead. Business of all kinds
  was at an end, except that of the coffin-makers and drivers of the pest-carte. Whole
  streets were shut up, and almost every other house in the city bore the fatal red
  cross, and the ominous inscription.
